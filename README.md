# Waveform

Waveform managment 

Given a waveform a vector (𝑇̅, 𝑌̅), write a Python function that will perform the following
operations:

    a. Returns a value y for any given t
    b. Accepts a sampling time 𝛥𝑡, and samples vector 𝑌̅ and returns a sampled 𝑌̅𝑆
    c. Write a simple test to demonstrate this functionality
